# MacOS OpenCore for Intel i3 10th Generation Desktop with AMD Radeon RX 570 4 GB

## Introduction
For the past few months, I've been working on getting macOS to run on my Intel desktop PC using OpenCore as the bootloader. It was a bit of a challenge at first. I spent a ton of time researching and experimenting with various settings. I had to use the integrated graphics card, the Intel UHD Graphics 630, because I still donâ€™t have a dedicated GPU.

Once I got the system up and running, I quickly found out that the integrated graphics card couldn't handle some of the more demanding applications that I needed to use. So, I decided to upgrade to the AMD Radeon RX 570 4 GB, which worked like a charm with my setup. However, getting it to work required a bit more tweaking to make sure my system used the dedicated graphics card instead of the integrated one.

After many more hours of tweaking and testing, I finally had a fully functional system that could handle everything I needed. It definitely wasn't easy or quick, but I learned a lot along the way and am pretty stoked with what I was able to accomplish.
